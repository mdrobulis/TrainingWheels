# Into

Clojure has many editors

And most of them are really complex
to install and setup properly.


# Emacs - One true Lisp Editor

Cider is the main plugin.
Well maintained. Full of many features.
Hard to setup and learn, for it is really big. 

# VS Code

Calva is the main plugin

Really popular. Simple. Really slow.

# Vim 

- Another universe on the other side of EMACS
- A chalange to learn keybindings.
I was never successful to setup properly.
